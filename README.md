# Stock Forecast App

## Overview

The Stock Forecast App is a web application that provides users with forecasts for selected stock prices using various forecasting techniques such as Prophet, ARIMA, Decision Tree Regressor, and LSTM. Users can choose a stock from a predefined list, specify the number of years for prediction, and compare the forecast results generated by different models.

## Functionalities

- **Stock Selection**: Users can select a stock from a predefined list including GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, and GME.
  
- **Forecasting**: The app provides forecasting using Prophet, ARIMA, Decision Tree Regressor, and LSTM techniques. Users can choose the number of years for prediction.
  
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts display raw stock data and forecasted values for visual analysis. Time series plots and forecast component plots are available for Prophet forecasts. Original data along with predicted values are shown for Decision Tree Regressor and LSTM models.
  
- **Metrics Calculation**: Forecast metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) are calculated for each forecasting technique.
  
- **Model Comparison**: Users can compare forecast performance across different models based on calculated metrics. The app highlights the best performing model based on the lowest metric values.
